key_findings:
  - "Chunwan interactive engagement evolved through 4 eras: shake-to-win (2015), card collection (2016+), short-video integration (2020-2024), and AI-powered experiences (2025-2026), each with order-of-magnitude participation increases."
  - "51.59% of 2024 Chunwan viewers are aged 15-44; mobile viewership grew 52.46% YoY in 2025; but TV still commands 78.88% share, confirming a dual-screen family viewing context."
  - "The 'simple entry + social sharing + real rewards' formula drives highest engagement; pure cash incentives without game loops fail (Baidu 2019: 2% retention)."
  - "2026 marks the 'AI Spring Festival' inflection point with Doubao, Yuanbao, Wenxin, and Ant Afu competing via AI-powered interactions."
  - "Taobao's 2025 Chunwan mini-game achieved 30 FPS on low-end devices and 1.74s first-screen load, proving mass-scale mini-game technical feasibility."

recommendations:
  - "Design a 'Family Living Room' cooperative game with differentiated roles for 3 generations (grandparent easy role, youth complex role) -- the biggest unoccupied design space."
  - "Implement a collectible + instant reward dual loop combining Alipay-style long-arc collection with immediate per-interaction rewards."
  - "Use AI for personalization (generated content, adaptive difficulty) rather than as a gating mechanic that excludes elderly users."
  - "Build for the full 7-day Spring Festival holiday period with daily evolving content, not just a single New Year's Eve spike."
  - "Synchronize game moments with the live broadcast timeline to create FOMO-driven engagement tied to the TV experience."
